# GraduationProject_Models

 ## optical character recognition
And we used EasyOCR.
-EasyOCR: it’s a very good model, easy to use it ,better than the two other models. 
supports more than 80 languages and can read natural and dense text in documents from the image in a good way.<br/>


## Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis):
And we used Transformer-based Models.<br/>
Transformer-based Models: It’s Better from the previous models because it has the highest accuracy, Used Hugging Face is an open-source AI community that offers a multitude of pre-trained models for NLP applications.<br/>
These models can be used as such or can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.<br/>


## Object detection 

And we used Single-Stage object detector <br/>
Single-Stage object detector have two model: YOLO,SSD <br/>
YOLO: have  many versions(YOLO, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5). <br/>
